Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".

2) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the JOIN by using the Foreign_keys.
3) Use DESC and DISTINCT when needed.
4) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the GROUP BY statement.
5) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the SELECT statement.
6) Only change the GROUP BY clause when necessary (Avoid redundant columns in GROUP BY).
7) Use GROUP BY on one column only.

<s> #### For the given question, use the provided tables, columns, foreign keys, and primary keys to fix the given SQLite SQL QUERY for any issues. If there are any problems, fix them. If there are no issues, return the SQLite SQL QUERY as is.
#### Use the following instructions for fixing the SQL QUERY:
1) Use the database values that are explicitly mentioned in the question.
2) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the JOIN by using the Foreign_keys.
3) Use DESC and DISTINCT when needed.
4) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the GROUP BY statement.
5) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the SELECT statement.
6) Only change the GROUP BY clause when necessary (Avoid redundant columns in GROUP BY).
7) Use GROUP BY on one column only.

Q: "count the number of patients whose diagnosis long title is morbid obesity and the lab test category is chemistry."
A: Let’s think step by step. In the question "count the number of patients whose diagnosis long title is morbid obesity and the lab test category is chemistry.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"whose diagnosis long title is morbid obesity" so we need column = [Diagnoses.LONG_TITLE]
"and the lab test category is chemistry" so we need column = [Lab.CATEGORY]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID,Lab.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [morbid obesity,chemistry]. So the Schema_links are:

So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question "among patients who had initial insertion of transvenous lead [electrode] into ventricle, caclulate the number of those who remained admitted in hospital for more than 9 days." needs these tables = [Demographic], so we don't need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".

A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question "Give the name and building of the departments with greater than average budget." needs these tables = [department], so we don't need JOIN.
Plus, it requires nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = ["What is the average budget of the departments"].
So, we don't need JOIN and need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED".

<s> #### For the given question, use the provided tables, columns, foreign keys, and primary keys to fix the given SQLite SQL QUERY for any issues. If there are any problems, fix them. If there are no issues, return the SQLite SQL QUERY as is.
#### Use the following instructions for fixing the SQL QUERY:
1) Use the database values that are explicitly mentioned in the question.
2) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the JOIN by using the Foreign_keys.
3) Use DESC and DISTINCT when needed.
4) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the GROUP BY statement.
5) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the SELECT statement.
6) Only change the GROUP BY clause when necessary (Avoid redundant columns in GROUP BY).
7) Use GROUP BY on one column only.

<s> #### For the given question, use the provided tables, columns, foreign keys, and primary keys to fix the given SQLite SQL QUERY for any issues. If there are any problems, fix them. If there are no issues, return the SQLite SQL QUERY as is.
#### Use the following instructions for fixing the SQL QUERY:
1) Use the database values that are explicitly mentioned in the question.
2) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the JOIN by using the Foreign_keys.
3) Use DESC and DISTINCT when needed.
4) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the GROUP BY statement.

2) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the JOIN by using the Foreign_keys.
3) Use DESC and DISTINCT when needed.
4) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the GROUP BY statement.
5) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the SELECT statement.
6) Only change the GROUP BY clause when necessary (Avoid redundant columns in GROUP BY).
7) Use GROUP BY on one column only.

A: Let’s think step by step. For creating the SQL for the given question, we need to join these tables = [Lab,Demographic]. First, create an intermediate representation, then use it to construct the SQL query.
Intermediate_representation: select count( distinct Lab.SUBJECT_ID) from Lab  where  Lab.ITEMID = 51438  and  Demographic.MARITAL_STATUS = "married"
SQL: SELECT count(DISTINCT T1.SUBJECT_ID) FROM Lab AS T1 JOIN Demographic AS T2 ON T1.SUBJECT_ID  =  T2.SUBJECT_ID WHERE T1.ITEMID  =  51438 AND T2.MARITAL_STATUS  =  'married'

Schema_links: [course.title,course.course_id = teaches.course_id,teaches.id = instructor.id,instructor.name,teaches.year,2008]
A: Let’s think step by step. For creating the SQL for the given question, we need to join these tables = [course,teaches,instructor]. First, create an intermediate representation, then use it to construct the SQL query.
Intermediate_representation: select course.title , instructor.name from course  where  teaches.year = 2008  order by course.title asc
SQL: SELECT T1.title ,  T3.name FROM course AS T1 JOIN teaches AS T2 ON T1.course_id  =  T2.course_id JOIN instructor AS T3 ON T2.id  =  T3.id WHERE T2.YEAR  =  2008 ORDER BY T1.title

Q: "how many female patients had joint replaced knee?

A: Let’s think step by step. For creating the SQL for the given question, we need to join these tables = [Demographic,Lab]. First, create an intermediate representation, then use it to construct the SQL query.
Intermediate_representation: select count( distinct Demographic.SUBJECT_ID) from Demographic  where  Demographic.AGE < 43  and  Lab.LABEL = 'transplant self medication program'
SQL: SELECT count(DISTINCT T1.SUBJECT_ID) FROM Demographic AS T1 JOIN Lab AS T2 ON T1.SUBJECT_ID  =  T2.SUBJECT_ID WHERE T1.AGE  <  43 AND T2.LABEL  =  'transplant self medication program'

Q: "how many patients admission location is transferred within this facility with the birth year before 2089?"
A: Let’s think step by step. In the question "how many patients admission location is transferred within this facility with the birth year before 2089?", we are asked:
"how many patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"admission location is transferred within this facility" so we need column = [Demographic.ADMISSION_LOCATION]
"with the birth year before 2089" so we need column = [Demographic.DOB_YEAR]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [2089]. So the Schema_links are:
Schema_links: [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID,Demographic.ADMISSION_LOCATION,Demographic.DOB_YEAR,2089]
