SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE" = "Mal neo descend colon"
count the number of patients whose diagnoses short title is mal neo descend colon.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "count the number of patients whose diagnoses short title is mal neo descend colon.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"whose diagnoses short title is mal neo descend colon" so we need column = [Diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = ['mal neo descend colon']. So the Schema_links are:
Schema_links: [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID,Diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE,'mal neo descend colon']
--------------------------------

[Demographic.SUBJECT_ID,Diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE,'mal neo descend colon']
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
The SQL query for the question "count the number of patients whose diagnoses short title is mal neo descend colon." needs these tables = [Demographic,Diagnoses], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".
Label: "NON-NESTED"

Tell me the number of patients admitted before 2198 who have a gentamicin sulfate drug prescription.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "Tell me the number of patients admitted before 2198 who have a gentamicin sulfate drug prescription.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"admitted before 2198" so we need column = [Demographic.ADMITTIME]
"have a gentamicin sulfate drug prescription" so we need column = [Prescriptions.DRUG]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Prescriptions.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [2198,gentamicin sulfate]. So the Schema_links are:

Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

Count the number of patients admitted to the hospital before year 2157 whose procedure long title is open reduction of fracture with internal fixation, femur.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "Count the number of patients admitted to the hospital before year 2157 whose procedure long title is open reduction of fracture with internal fixation, femur.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"admitted to the hospital" so we need column = [Demographic.ADMITTIME]
"before year 2157" so we need column = [Demographic.ADMITTIME]
"whose procedure long title is open reduction of fracture with internal fixation, femur" so we need column = [Procedures.LONG_TITLE]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [2157,open reduction of fracture with internal fixation, femur]. So the Schema_links are:

LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
The SQL query for the question "Count the number of patients admitted to the hospital before year 2157 whose procedure long title is open reduction of fracture with internal fixation, femur." needs these tables = [Demographic,Procedures], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

"patients are divorced" so we need column = [Demographic.MARITAL_STATUS]
"have their drug route as iv drip" so we need column = [Lab.ROUTE]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Prescriptions.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID,Lab.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [divorced,iv drip]. So the Schema_links are:

LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
The SQL query for the question "What number of  patients are divorced and have their drug route as iv drip?" needs these tables = [Prescriptions,Demographic,Lab], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

give me the number of elective hospital admission patients who are diagnosed with other and unspecified open wound of head without mention of complication.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "give me the number of elective hospital admission patients who are diagnosed with other and unspecified open wound of head without mention of complication.", we are asked:
"the number of elective hospital admission patients" so we need column = [Demographic.ADMISSION_TYPE]
"who are diagnosed with other and unspecified open wound of head" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
"without mention of complication" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [other and unspecified open wound of head,complication]. So the Schema_links are:
Schema_links: [Demographic.ADMISSION_TYPE,Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE,other and unspecified open wound of head,complication,Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID]

LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
The SQL query for the question "give me the number of elective hospital admission patients who are diagnosed with other and unspecified open wound of head without mention of complication." needs these tables = [Demographic,Diagnoses], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "calculate the number of patients with gstr/ddnts nos w/o hemorrhage who were on self-pay", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"with gstr/ddnts nos" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
"w/o hemorrhage" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]

In the question "how many patients are in admission location clinic referral/premature and with diagnosis icd9 code 431?", we are asked:
"how many patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"in admission location clinic referral/premature" so we need column = [Demographic.ADMISSION_LOCATION]
"with diagnosis icd9 code 431" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [431,clinic referral/premature]. So the Schema_links are:
Schema_links: [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID,Demographic.ADMISSION_LOCATION,Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE,431,clinic referral/premature,Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID]
--------------------------------

[Demographic.SUBJECT_ID,Demographic.ADMISSION_LOCATION,Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE,431,clinic referral/premature,Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID]
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
The SQL query for the question "how many patients are in admission location clinic referral/premature and with diagnosis icd9 code 431?" needs these tables = [Demographic,Diagnoses], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

count the number of patients whose admission location is phys referral/normal deli and drig code is cefe 1i.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "count the number of patients whose admission location is phys referral/normal deli and drig code is cefe 1i.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"whose admission location is phys referral/normal deli" so we need column = [Demographic.ADMISSION_LOCATION]
"and drig code is cefe 1i" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = ['Phys Referral/Normal Delivery', 'cefe 1i']. So the Schema_links are:

In the question "How many patients with left colon cancer died in or before the year 2138?", we are asked:
"How many patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"with left colon cancer" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
"died" so we need column = [Demographic.DOD]
"in or before the year 2138" so we need column = [Demographic.DOD_YEAR]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [2138]. So the Schema_links are:

Count the number of patients whose primary disease is pneumonia human immunodeficiency virus but not tuberculosis and procedure short title is aortocor bypas-2 cor art.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "Count the number of patients whose primary disease is pneumonia human immunodeficiency virus but not tuberculosis and procedure short title is aortocor bypas-2 cor art.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"whose primary disease is" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
"pneumonia human immunodeficiency virus" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
"but not tuberculosis" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]

Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID,Procedures.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [pneumonia,human,immunodeficiency,virus,tuberculosis,aortocor,bypas-2,cor,art]. So the Schema_links are:

Let me know the number of patients taking drugs via pr route who have overdose as their primary disease.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "Let me know the number of patients taking drugs via pr route who have overdose as their primary disease.", we are asked:
"the number of patients taking drugs via pr route" so we need column = [Prescriptions.DRUG_TYPE,Prescriptions.ROUTE]
"who have overdose as their primary disease" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Prescriptions.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID,Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [pr,overdose]. So the Schema_links are:

The SQL query for the question "Let me know the number of patients taking drugs via pr route who have overdose as their primary disease." needs these tables = [Prescriptions,Diagnoses], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

how many patients are primarily suffering from brain mass; intracranial hemorrhage and their lab test fluid is urine?
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "how many patients are primarily suffering from brain mass; intracranial hemorrhage and their lab test fluid is urine?", we are asked:
"patients are primarily suffering from brain mass; intracranial hemorrhage" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
"their lab test fluid is urine" so we need column = [Lab.FLUID]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [brain mass,intracranial hemorrhage,urine]. So the Schema_links are:

In the question "provide the number of patients who were born before the year 2052 and underwent the lab test alanine aminotransferase (alt).", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Lab.SUBJECT_ID]
"born before the year 2052" so we need column = [Demographic.DOB_YEAR]
"underwent the lab test alanine aminotransferase (alt)" so we need column = [Lab.ITEMID]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Lab.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [2052,alt]. So the Schema_links are:

provide the number of patients with procedure icd9 code 3607 who died on or before 2158.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "provide the number of patients with procedure icd9 code 3607 who died on or before 2158.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]

"who died on or before 2158" so we need column = [Demographic.DOD]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [3607,2158]. So the Schema_links are:

"the number of patients" so we need column = [Lab.SUBJECT_ID]
"lab test item id is 50927" so we need column = [Lab.ITEMID]
"year of admission is before 2180" so we need column = [Demographic.ADMITTIME]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Lab.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [50927,2180]. So the Schema_links are:
Schema_links: [Lab.SUBJECT_ID,Lab.ITEMID,50927,Demographic.ADMITTIME,Demographic.ADMITYEAR,2180]

LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
The SQL query for the question "provide the number of patients whose lab test item id is 50927 and year of admission is before 2180." needs these tables = [Lab,Demographic], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

count the number of patients whose diagnosis icd9 code is 53081 and lab test category is hematology.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "count the number of patients whose diagnosis icd9 code is 53081 and lab test category is hematology.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"whose diagnosis icd9 code is 53081" so we need column = [Diagnoses.ICD9_CODE]
"and lab test category is hematology" so we need column = [Lab.CATEGORY]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID,Lab.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [53081,hematology]. So the Schema_links are:

get me the number of patients on ih route of drug administration who have diagnoses of pneumonia, unspecified organism.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "get me the number of patients on ih route of drug administration who have diagnoses of pneumonia, unspecified organism.", we are asked:
"number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"on ih route of drug administration" so we need column = [Prescriptions.ROUTE]

give the number of patients whose diagnoses long title is personal history of malignant neoplasm of bladder and lab test abnormal status is abnormal.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "give the number of patients whose diagnoses long title is personal history of malignant neoplasm of bladder and lab test abnormal status is abnormal.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.SUBJECT_ID]
"whose diagnoses long title is personal history of malignant neoplasm of bladder" so we need column = [Diagnoses.LONG_TITLE]
"and lab test abnormal status is abnormal" so we need column = [Lab.FLAG]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [Diagnoses.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID,Lab.HADM_ID = Demographic.HADM_ID].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [personal history of malignant neoplasm of bladder,abnormal]. So the Schema_links are:

Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

provide the number of patients whose drug code is warf1 and lab test fluid is pleural.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "provide the number of patients whose drug code is warf1 and lab test fluid is pleural.", we are asked:
"the number of patients" so we need column = [Prescriptions.SUBJECT_ID]
"whose drug code is" so we need column = [Prescriptions.DRUG_TYPE]
"and lab test fluid is" so we need column = [Lab.FLUID]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [warf1,pleural]. So the Schema_links are:

In the question "Specify the maximum age of patients who were admitted to the hospital in or after the year 2187 and stayed for 34 days", we are asked:
"the maximum age of patients" so we need column = [Demographic.AGE]
"who were admitted to the hospital in or after the year 2187" so we need column = [Demographic.ADMITTIME]
"and stayed for 34 days" so we need column = [Demographic.DAYS_STAY]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [2187,34]. So the Schema_links are:
Schema_links: [Demographic.AGE,Demographic.ADMITTIME,Demographic.DAYS_STAY,2187,34]
--------------------------------

[Demographic.AGE,Demographic.ADMITTIME,Demographic.DAYS_STAY,2187,34]
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
The SQL query for the question "Specify the maximum age of patients who were admitted to the hospital in or after the year 2187 and stayed for 34 days" needs these tables = [Demographic], so we don't need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".
Label: "EASY"

LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
SELECT max(AGE) FROM Demographic WHERE ADMITTIME  >=  '2187-01-01' AND DAYS_STAY  =  34
--------------------------------

SELECT max(AGE) FROM Demographic WHERE ADMITTIME  >=  '2187-01-01' AND DAYS_STAY  =  34
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
max(AGE) FROM Demographic WHERE ADMITTIME  >=  '2187-01-01' AND DAYS_STAY  =  34
--------------------------------

Predicted non-capitalized:SELECT max(AGE) FROM Demographic WHERE ADMITTIME  >=  '2187-01-01' AND DAYS_STAY  =  34
Predicted:SELECT max(AGE) FROM Demographic WHERE ADMITTIME  >=  '2187-01-01' AND DAYS_STAY  =  34
Gold:SELECT MAX ( DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DAYS_STAY" = "34" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."ADMITYEAR" >= "2187"
