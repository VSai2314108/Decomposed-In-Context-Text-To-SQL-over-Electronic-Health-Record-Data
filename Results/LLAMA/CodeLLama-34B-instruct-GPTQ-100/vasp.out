SELECT sum(ranking_points) ,  T1.first_name FROM players AS T1 JOIN rankings AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T1.first_name
Find the total ranking points for each player and their first name.
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
In the question "Find the total ranking points for each player and their first name.", we are asked:
"the total ranking points for each player" so we need column = [rankings.ranking_points]
"and their first name" so we need column = [players.first_name]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [rankings.player_id = players.player_id].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = []. So the Schema_links are:
Schema_links: [rankings.ranking_points,players.first_name,rankings.player_id = players.player_id]
--------------------------------

[rankings.ranking_points,players.first_name,rankings.player_id = players.player_id]
LLAMA Answer--------------------------------
The SQL query for the question "Find the total ranking points for each player and their first name." needs these tables = [rankings,players], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".
